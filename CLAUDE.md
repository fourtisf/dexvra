# Dexvra — working notes

## Repo layout

| Path | What it is | Runs as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/`, root `package.json` | Next.js 14 web app (dexvra.io) | PM2 `dexvra`, port 3005 |
| `bot/` | Telegram bot — listings, trending, banners, group buy bot, raids | PM2 `dexvra-bot` **and** `dexvra-adminbot` |
| `tradebot/` | The trade bot, a separate process in the same repo | its own PM2 process |

Production server: the repo is checked out at **`/opt/dexvra`**. Never write
`/path/to/dexvra` in an instruction — it has been pasted literally into a live
shell before.

## Release flow — `main` is what the server runs

**Every change ends up on `main`, and the server only ever deploys `main`.**
Feature branches exist to build and review on; they are never the thing a
server checks out.

1. Build on a branch (`claude/<topic>`), commit there.
2. Run the full suite for whatever you touched — **it must be green before the
   merge, not after**:
   ```bash
   cd bot && npm test          # bot/       (~930 tests)
   npm test                    # web app, from the repo root
   cd tradebot && npm test     # tradebot/
   ```
3. Merge into `main` and push `main`.
4. Deploy on the server **from `main`** — see [`bot/DEPLOY.md`](bot/DEPLOY.md).
5. **Verify what is running before believing anything about it.** Every process
   prints its commit at boot.

A branch left unmerged after it is deployed is the failure mode this rule
exists to prevent: the server sits on a branch, the next change is cut from
`main`, and the two silently diverge.

If a pull request for a branch has already been merged, do not add commits to
that branch — restart it from the current `main` and open a new one.

### The whole deploy, all four processes

```bash
cd /opt/dexvra && git checkout main && git pull origin main
cd /opt/dexvra/bot && pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --update-env   # dexvra-bot + dexvra-adminbot
pm2 restart dexvra-tradebot --update-env                             # tradebot/ — its OWN process
# web app (only if src/ or the repo root changed):
cd /opt/dexvra && npm run build && pm2 restart dexvra
pm2 ls
```

### Step 5 is not optional

```bash
pm2 logs dexvra-bot      --lines 50 --nostream | grep '\[boot\] build'
pm2 logs dexvra-tradebot --lines 50 --nostream | grep '\[boot\]'
```

The sha printed must equal `git rev-parse --short HEAD`. A `+dirty` suffix means
the checkout has uncommitted changes and is **not** what `main` says it is.

This exists because a pull that never reached the server and a change that did
not work are indistinguishable from Telegram, and an evening was spent debugging
the first while assuming the second. Do not report a fix as deployed, and do not
start diagnosing why one "did not work", until the sha matches.

### Config a fix depends on

A code change that needs a new `.env` value is not finished when it is merged —
it is finished when the value is set. Say so explicitly, with the exact variable
name, and expect the behaviour to be unchanged until then. `data/`, `.env` and
`.keys/` live only on the server, so nothing here can set them.

Uniswap v4 used to be the standing example of this and no longer is. It needed
`<CHAIN>_V4_POOLMANAGER` to price and `<CHAIN>_V4_UNIVERSAL_ROUTER` +
`<CHAIN>_V4_PERMIT2` to trade, and until an operator pasted all three a live
pool read as "Dexvra can't route through that yet". `tradebot/v4.js` now
observes all of it from the chain's own logs — the PoolManager from the pool's
Initialize log, the router from the senders of that manager's Swap logs, Permit2
from its deterministic address (verified by `getCode`) — and caches it per
chain. The env vars still exist and still win when set; they are an override and
a discovery skip, not a prerequisite. `<CHAIN>_V4_AUTODISCOVER=0` pins a chain
to env alone.

## Two bot processes, one config

`bot/` runs **two** PM2 processes: `dexvra-bot` (`main.js`) and
`dexvra-adminbot` (`adminbot.js`). Always restart via the ecosystem file:

```bash
cd /opt/dexvra/bot && pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --update-env && pm2 ls
```

`pm2 restart dexvra-bot` leaves the admin bot on the old code. It fails
silently and confusingly — the main bot shows a new feature working while
@dexvraadminbot has no menu entry for it, which reads as "the feature is
missing" rather than "that process is stale". Confirm both are `online`.

## Admin-editable templates beat code defaults

`bot/src/templates.js` holds a built-in default for every message; anything an
admin saved in @dexvraadminbot lives in `data/templates.json` and **wins**.
So changing a default in code does nothing on a box where that template was
edited. Say so when shipping copy changes: the operator has to hit
**♻️ Reset default** on that template to pick the new copy up.

The same applies to `data/` generally — it is gitignored, lives only on the
server, and survives `git pull`. So do `.env` and `.keys/`.

## What does not need a web rebuild

If a change touches only `bot/`, there is no `npm run build` and no
`pm2 restart dexvra`. Check before telling anyone to rebuild:

```bash
git diff --name-only <base>..HEAD | grep -v '^bot/'
```

Empty output means bot-only.

## The raid reads X by default — and an explicit `0` still wins

"bisa baca like rt komen dan updated realtime" (2026-08-12). The reading code
was already complete — `bot/src/raid/` has the paid API, the guest GraphQL
source and the embed source, tried in that order. **Nothing was missing and
nothing needed cloning.** What was wrong is that all three shipped OFF:
`X_BEARER_TOKEN` blank, `RAID_FREE_METRICS=0`, `RAID_GUEST_METRICS=0`. So
`xMetrics.anySource()` was false on a stock box, every raid launched crew-only,
and the like/reply/repost numbers could never move. From inside Telegram that
is indistinguishable from a broken feature: the goals are on the card and the
counts sit still.

- **`bot/src/raid/sourceFlag.js` is the single owner** of "is this keyless
  source on?". Absent or blank → ON. `RAID_FREE_METRICS=0` / `=false` / `=off`
  → OFF, and that must stay expressible: both modules carry real warnings (X
  blocks datacenter IPs hardest; the embed source's reply count is the whole
  CONVERSATION, so it can disagree with the number X prints on the post).
- **Blank ≠ false here**, deliberately, unlike `bool()` in
  `src/config/constants.js`. A `.env` carrying a bare `RAID_GUEST_METRICS=` is
  "never decided", not "refused".
- ⚠️ **A server whose `.env` was copied from the old template still says `=0`,
  and that wins.** The default change alone does nothing there — set both to
  `1` (or delete the lines) and restart with `--update-env`. This is the
  "config a fix depends on" rule above, and it is the single most likely reason
  the counts still look frozen after a deploy.
- **The two keyless sources are NOT independent fallbacks.** Both are gated by
  X's IP reputation, so a datacenter block takes them out together. Only the
  paid token (metered per app, not per IP) and the 🤝 Crew goal (zero X
  requests) are genuinely independent. The fallback chain reads more reassuring
  than it is.

**Realtime is `RAID_MOVE_BUMP_SEC`, now 0** (floor 0, was 60 with a floor of
20). When a like/reply/repost/crew join lands, the card is re-posted on the
NEXT poll instead of being edited in place — **an in-place edit notifies
nobody**, so from anywhere in the chat except directly on the card, a raid
that is progressing looked exactly like one that had stalled. Zero is safe
because the flood bound is `RAID_POLL_SEC`: a bump can only happen inside a
tick, and a tick that saw nothing move sends nothing. Chatter is a different
event and keeps its full `RAID_BUMP_MINUTES`.

**X rotates its GraphQL hash, so the seed is expected to be stale.**
`xGuest.js` resolves the operation id in three tiers — `X_GUEST_QUERY_ID` →
one discovered from x.com's own JS bundle → the built-in seed — and discovery
runs only after a 404 has proved the current id stale, at most once per six
hours. A rotation therefore publishes its own fix instead of silently costing
every group its repost count. Do **not** "fix" a 404 by editing the seed. A
pinned `X_GUEST_QUERY_ID` is never overruled (it is the escape hatch), so clear
it once a rotation passes or it becomes the stale one.

```bash
cd bot && npm run raid:check     # which source answers from THIS box, and why not
```

Whether X answers is a property of the server's egress today, not of the code,
so it has to be measured on the box.

## Conventions

- Tests live beside the code they cover, in `bot/test/`, `tradebot/*.test.js`
  and `src/**/*.test.ts`. A behaviour change without a test that would have
  caught the old behaviour is not finished.
- Comments explain **why**, and name the failure the code is shaped around.
  Match the density of the file you are editing.
- Operator-facing strings in @dexvraadminbot are **Indonesian**; user-facing
  bot copy and channel posts are English.
